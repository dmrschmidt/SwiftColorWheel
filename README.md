If you really like this library (aka Sponsoring)

I'm doing all this for fun and joy and because I strongly believe in the power of open source. On the off-chance though, that using my library has brought joy to you and you just feel like saying "thank you", I would smile like a 4-year old getting a huge ice cream cone, if you'd support my via one of the sponsoring buttons ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï

If you're feeling in the mood of sending someone else a lovely gesture of appreciation, maybe check out my iOS app [üíå SoundCard](https://www.soundcard.io) to send them a real postcard with a personal audio message.

# Installation

## Swift Package Manager

Just add `https://github.com/dmrschmidt/SwiftColorWheel` and select "Up to Next Major"

## Carthage

Simply add the following to your Cartfile and run `carthage update`:

```
github "dmrschmidt/SwiftColorWheel", ~> 1.5
```

# Usage

Either, add a `ColorWheel` or `RotatingColorWheel` as a custom `UIView` subclass to your interface builder. Alternatively, you can of course simply add it programmatically as a subview to any normal `UIView`.

This will already render your color picker. However it doesn't react on your taps yet. For that, set yourself as it's `delegate`. See the very simplified code example below:

```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, ColorWheelDelegate {
    private var colorWheel: ColorWheel!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        colorWheel = ColorWheel(frame: view.frame)
        colorWheel.delegate = self
        view.addSubview(colorWheel)
    }

    // MARK: - ColorWheelDelegate

    func didSelect(color: UIColor) {
        view.backgroundColor = color
    }
}
```

# Customization

You can modify the look of the color wheel through various exposed properties.

```swift
// Extra padding in points to the view border.
colorWheel.padding = 13.0

// Radius in point of the central color circle (for black & white shades).
colorWheel.centerRadius = 5.0

// Smallest circle radius in point.
colorWheel.minCircleRadius = 1.0

// Largest circle radius in point.
colorWheel.maxCircleRadius = 5.0

// Padding between circles in point.
colorWheel.innerPadding = 3

/**
 Degree by which each row of circles is shifted.
 A value of 0 results in a straight layout of the inner circles.
 A value other than 0 results in a slightly shifted, fractal-ish / flower-ish look.
*/
colorWheel.shiftDegree = 0

// Overall density of inner circles.
colorWheel.density = 1.0

// Stroke color highlighting currently selected color. Set nil to disable highlighting.
// Default is UIColor.white.
colorWheel.highlightStrokeColor = nil
```

In some case (like when a `RotatingColorWheel` is placed inside a `UIScrollView`) you may want to tweak the default gesture handling for the rotation. If you do so, you can get access to the original gesture handler and use it in composition.

```swift
let originalHandler = rotatingWheel.panRecognizer.delegate
yourRetainedHandler = YourTweakedHandler(complementing: originalHandler)
rotatingWheel.panRecognizer.delegate = yourRetainedHandler
rotatingWheel.rotateRecognizer.delegate = yourRetainedHandler
```

`YourTweakedHandler` could then implement `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin(_:)` in conjunction with the originally provided handler.
